    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>
    <h2>Ingrédients</h2>
    <ul class="ulingredients">
        <li>Evaporated milk: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li>Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Cream of coconut: Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li>White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li>Water: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li>Spices: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>

    </ul>
